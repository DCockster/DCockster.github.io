					<p>So who is DirDisrespect? </p>
					<p>Herschel "Guy" Beahm IV, commonly known by his online alias Dr Disrespect, is an American Internet celebrity, current YouTube streamer, and former Twitch streamer. Beahm had accumulated more than four million followers on Twitch and is best known for playing battle royale video games, such as H1Z1, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Black Ops 4: Blackout, Call of Duty: Warzone, Apex Legends and Fortnite. His streams are known for having a high production value. Beahm's estimated net worth is about $3.5 million.

On June 26, 2020, Beahm was banned from Twitch for unexplained reasons and his channel was removed from the site. Sources have reported that the ban is permanent.He returned to streaming on August 7, 2020, on YouTube with a total peak of more than 510,000 concurrent viewers.</p>
					<p>Beahm graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona in 2005, where he played NCAA Division II basketball.

Beahm's first video was posted on January 11, 2010, showing gameplay of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. He was featured in multiple videos for the gaming channel Machinima, mostly playing Call of Duty. Beahm went inactive from YouTube in late 2011 and did not release any content for nearly five years.

On March 16, 2011, Beahm was appointed as the community manager of Sledgehammer Games.He was promoted to level designer and helped create many of the multiplayer maps for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.Beahm joined Justin.tv (now Twitch) while he was working at Sledgehammer. He quit Sledgehammer in 2015 to focus on a full-time streaming career.

Beahm gained a following from playing battle royale games, starting with H1Z1 before switching to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and then moving on to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. In December 2017, he took a two-month hiatus from streaming to tend to his relationship with his wife, after having admitted to being unfaithful to her.Beahm and his wife have a daughter. He returned on February 5, 2018, with a total peak of 388,000 concurrent viewers, just shy of beating Tyler1's record of 410,000.His popularity has led to sponsorship deals with Gillette, ASUS, Roccat and Game Fuel.

According to Beahm, on September 11, 2018, an unknown person shot at his house with a BB gun and hit an upstairs window. This was reportedly the second time that someone shot at his house.

On January 10, 2019, Creative Artists Agency signed Beahm as a client.

Beahm signed a multi-year deal with Twitch in March 2020.

On August 17, 2020, Beahm announced that he was writing a personal memoir called Violence. Speed. Momentum. This book was released to the public on March 30, 2021.

Streaming persona
Beahm's on-stream persona is usually ruthless, quick-witted, and bombastic. He is often regarded as an entertainer in the streaming industry, rather than a "professional gamer." ESPN describes him as "a WWE character in the competitive gaming world", and he has himself said "I created a character who plays multiplayer video games, and he's considered the most dominating gaming specimen."

When playing the Dr Disrespect character, Beahm wears a black mullet wig, sunglasses, a red or black long-sleeved athletic moisture-wicking shirt, and a red or black tactical vest. He sports a mustache he has named "Slick Daddy" aka "The Poisonous Ethiopian Caterpillar".</p>
